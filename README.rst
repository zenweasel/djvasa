(watered-down-salt)

This project is based heavily on the project Djvasa by Chad Gallemore.

While the goal of Djvasa is to provision and brand new vagrant box ready to start on, Saline is meant to provision
a new vagrant box into an existing project, allowing the developer to serve their existing project through a local VM
as well as testing deployment methods.

Like Djvasa, we assume you already have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed and that you have the salty-vagrant
plugin installed.  If you have Vagrant and VirtualBox already, but need the plugin, you can install like so:

::

    >> vagrant plugin install vagrant-salt
